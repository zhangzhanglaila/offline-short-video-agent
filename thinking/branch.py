"""Branch & Merge — Git for Media.

Enables parallel exploration of creative directions:
  branch A: rewrite narration
  branch B: rewrite visuals
  merge(): combine changes with conflict detection

This turns the ThinkingSession into a version-controlled
creative workspace, where every edit is a patch and every
branch is an alternative timeline.

Conflict types (media-specific):
  TEXT_EDIT:      Same sentence edited differently in both branches
  TIMING_EDIT:    Same clip timing changed in both branches
  STRUCTURAL:     Sentence added/removed in one, edited in other
  GRAPH_EDIT:     Same graph node changed in both branches
  MODULE_STATUS:  Module approval status differs

Resolution strategies:
  OURS:           Keep the current branch's version
  THEIRS:         Accept the incoming branch's version
  MANUAL:         User resolves via edit instruction
  AUTO_MERGE:     Non-conflicting changes merged automatically
